      <h1>About Ian Parberry's Towers of Hanoi</h1>


      <p>
        Over two decades ago Mike Fellows (pictured below, left) and I wrote the following in
        "SIGACT Trying to Get Children Excited About CS", <em>Computing Research News</em>, Vol. 5, No. 1, p. 7, 1993
        (<a class="gray" href="http:///larc.unt.edu/ian/pubs/crn1993.pdf">pdf</a>):
      </p>


      <img class="hlp" style="float: left; margin: 5px; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 40px; border: 1px solid black;"

      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 30px;">
        "What would we like our children &ndash; the
        general public of the future &ndash; to
        learn about computer science in
        schools? We need to do away with the
        myth that computer science is about
        computers. Computer science is no
        more about computers than astronomy
        is about telescopes, biology is about
        microscopes or chemistry is about
        beakers and test tubes. Science is not
        about tools. It is about how we use them
        and what we find out when we do."

        The part that is misattributed to Dijkstra <a class="gray" href="http://larc.unt.edu/ian/research/cseducation#megamath">should actually be attributed to Mike Fellows</a>.)
        We then went on to say:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 30px;">
        "It may come as a surprise to some
        that computer science is full of activities
        that children will find exciting even
        without the use of computers."
      </p>

        Much has changed in the world of computers since 1993.
        We now have desktop PCs that are more powerful
        than 1993's supercomputers and pocket devices
        that allow us to access the sum total of human knowledge
        in an instant (which devices, as it is popularly said, are
        used primarily to watch funny cat videos).
        Much has changed also in the world of computer science education since 1993.
        For one thing, active learning, in which students undertake activities instead of being lectured at in class,
        has taken the leap from general education to computer science classes.

        Examining the graph of CS Bachelor's degrees awarded in the US
        from 1971 to 2011 above (click for a larger image), we see that undergraduate Computer Science
        enrolments appear to be increasing exponentially after
        a slump during the first decade of this century.
        This kind of increase has happened twice before,
        but the difference now is that the general public, dizzy from exposure to
        the internet and the world of tech startups, now seem to agree that everybody needs to learn how to program.
        But there's the rub, as Shakespeare's Hamlet might have put it. To be an effective programmer one needs to know much, much more than the syntax
        and semantics of a few programming languages.
        Alan Perlis (seen below left) wrote in
        "Epigrams on Programming,"
        <em>ACM SIGPLAN Notices</em>, Vol. 17, No. 9, pp. 7–13, 1982:

      <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 30px;">
        "It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to program. What fun is there in making plans,
        acquiring discipline in organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self-critical?"

        While the Towers of Hanoi seems to have been used in introductory programming
        classes since the Dawn of Time, it is my experience that most instructors
        don't use it to the fullest extent.
        Instead of using it (paraphrasing Perlis) to encourage students to make plans,
        acquire discipline in organizing thoughts, and devote attention to detail,
        I've seen instructors simply flash a pseudocode
        algorithm and tell students to get on with it.

        For a quarter of a century
        I've used this wooden Towers of Hanoi in my Algorithms class
        so that I can do things like wave it around, pause it, restart it, and solve it with the
        <a class="gray" href="help.html#restrictions">5 Restrictions on Motion</a> right there, live in front of the students.
        This works well for a class of around 30, but
        in Spring 2016 I taught a class of 110 in a very wide classroom with two projectors.
        Clearly my small wooden toy wouldn't be visible in such a setting.
        This motivated me to create <a class="gray" href="index.html">Ian Parberry's Towers of Hanoi</a>, which I can show on two projectors simultaneously
        so that the whole class can see it clearly, and students can use themselves while at home between watching humorous cat videos. In addition, the <a class="gray" href="index64.html">history page</a> contains a real-time
        simulation of the Towers of Hanoi with 64 discs which can be restarted at various points in history
        to emphasize to students what exponential time really means.

        Its technology was only a dream in 1993, but
        in the same vein as our quote from <em>Computing Research News</em>,
        <a class="gray" href="index.html">Ian Parberry's Towers of Hanoi</a>
        can be used in <a class="gray" href="activelearning.html">hands-on activities</a> that enable students to engage in
        algorithmic thinking, which is key to becoming a programmer.
        Only the last two sets of activities actually involve programming.
        The
        <a class="gray" href="activelearning.html#competitiveactivities">beginning activities</a> are at the level of an elementary schooler.
        At the other end of the scale, some of the <a class="gray" href="activelearning.html#aaa8">Algorithm Analysis Activities</a> involve some quite hairy mathematics that would challenge a graduate student.
        In between, you should be able to find activities that stretch the abilities of
        students at almost all levels.
