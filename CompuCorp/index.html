    <h1>Programming Experience</h1>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
        I write code
        pretty much every day, mostly
        for my academic research, for use in the 
		<a href="https://larc.unt.edu/classes.html">classroom</a>,
		or for the occasional 
		<a href=http://ianparberry.com/consultcontract/>contracting or consulting</a> gig.
        You can see some of my code on my
        <a href="https://github.com/Ian-Parberry">GitHub</a> repository.
        The programming language that I use the most these days is C++
		using Visual Studio under Windows and g++ under Linux.
        I've also written programs in
        Ada,
        Algol 68,
        Basic,
        BCPL,
        C,
        Cobol,
        Fortran IV and Fortran 10,
        Lisp,
        Java,
        JavaScript,
        Modula-2,
        Pascal,
        PL/I,
        Python,
        Ratfor,
        Ruby,
        Simula,
        Snobol,
        and assembly languages for various architectures including
        Intel, Motorola, and the
        CompuCorp 325 that features below.
      </p>

    <h2>Programming Language Timeline</h1>
	
	<div class=content>
	  <p>
	    I wrote my first programs as a high school student in 1975-1976
        in assembly code and Fortran IV, both of which
		are described in more detail below.	
	    As an undergraduate in 1977-1980 the instruction was
		mostly in Pascal, and we were also taught
		Ada,
        Algol 68,
        BCPL,
        C,
        Cobol,
        Fortran 10,
        Lisp,
        Modula-2,
        Ratfor,
        Simula,
        Snobol,
        and Intel and Motorola assembly languages.
		The only one of these that I use today is of course C.
		I also learned Basic to write some timetable code for
		the math teacher back at my high school which had since purchased
		a PDP 11. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    While a graduate student I programmed exclusively in C,
		but when I started Assistant Professoring at Penn State
		I found that the instructional language was PL/I,
		which I therefore had to learn. I learned C++ in the
		early 1990s at the University of North Texas
		so that I could teach game programming.
		Somewhere along the way I learned 
        Logo so that I could experiment with L-systems,
        Java because everybody was talking about it (I wasn't impressed),
        JavaScript for my web pages,
        Python for various reasons,
        and Ruby because Mary Sheeran, an expert in functional programming,
		recommended it to me.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Somehow C++ remains my language of choice. I've probably written over 50,000 lines of code in it by now.

    <h2>My First Programs</h1>
	
	<div class=content>
      <img class=centered alt="image" width="50%" src="images/compucorp.png">

      <p>
        I wrote my first program at the age of 16 in 1975 in
        Grade 11 at
        <a href="https://beenleighshs.eq.edu.au/">Beenleigh State High School</a>
        in Queensland, Australia on a CompuCorp 325.
        Output was in the form of an 18-character red LED and
        a narrow 18-character drum printer
        that could noisily and slowly print in black and red ink.
        It wasn't intended for use by students, but I managed to get permission to
        teach myself how to program it.
      </p>

      <p>
        My first programs were, of course, games.
      </p>

      <img class=centered width="42%" alt="image" src="images/parabola.png">

      <p>
        One of my first programs
        was a projectile game in which the player is given a random target distance $s$ and has to enter the
        barrel angle $\theta$ for a cannon with fixed muzzle speed $v$ (see the diagram above),
        and must hit the target with three shots. Since the player is not told the muzzle speed,
        which changes randomly with each target, they must experiment and estimate
        the correct angle based on the distance that they missed by.
      </p>

      <img style="float:left;  margin-right:20px;" alt="image" src="images/components.png">
      <img style="float:right; margin-left:20px;" alt="image" src="images/vertical.png">

      <p>
        Coding up this game requires simple quadratic equations that even an 11th grader should know.
        Let $v_y = v \sin \theta$ be the magnitude of the vertical component of the muzzle velocity
        (see the diagram at left).
        If the projectile is fired upwards with muzzle velocity $v_y$,
        it reaches its highest point (see the diagram at right) when
        $v_y - gt = 0$ where $g = 9.8 \mbox{m/sec/sec}$, that is, when $t = v_y/g = v \sin \theta/g$.
        Therefore, the projectile's time in flight is $2t = 2 v \sin \theta/g$ seconds.
        The projectile travels a horizontal distance of $h = 2v_x t = 2 v^2 \cos \theta \sin \theta/9.8$ meters.
        If $h$ is close enough to $s$, then it's a hit. Otherwise, tell the player that they've missed
        by $h - s$ meters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another of my first programs was a variant of the game of Nim.
        There are many variants of this game (see, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#Dividing_natural_number">Wikipedia</a>),
        but I can't remember exactly which one it was. I remember learning the winning
        strategy from a book that was in the Beenleigh public library in 1975, but again
        I can't remember exactly which book that was either.

    <h2>FORTRAN IV</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
        At the end of 11th grade I attended a summer programming camp at the
        <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland</a>.
        This was some time between December 1975 and February 1976 (southern hemisphere, remember).
        There I learned to program in FORTRAN IV using flowcharts. I didn't actually come anywhere
        near a computer. Instead, we programmed on coding forms that looked something like these:
      </p>

      <img class=centered alt="image" src="images/FortranCodingForm.png">

      <p>
        Our program forms were typed up on punch cards overnight
        by "professional" data entry personnel whose primary purpose seemed to be
        the adding of random compile time errors to each card deck.
        The card decks were submitted to the university's DEC PDP KA-10 overnight and
        the output was delivered to us the next morning.
        This didn't work very well because it meant
        that we could only compile once per day, and the data entry staff were apparently
        a group of chimpanzees wearing boxing gloves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hardest thing we had to program was computing binomial coefficients.
        FORTRAN IV doesn't have recursion, so it wasn't a trivial problem for a 16 year old.
        I didn't know about Pascal's triangle at the time, either.
        Remember, the internet didn't exist then, so we couldn't just look things up.
        I remember that my solution was hopelessly Byzantine but I never got to see whether it worked
        or not because of the chimpanzees in boxing gloves thing.
        I'm pretty safe in guessing that it failed miserably.
