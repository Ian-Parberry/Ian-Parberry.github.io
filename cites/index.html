      <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> shows the sorted
      number of cites per publication for publications that have been cited at least 10 times.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <p>
      If we define a <em>high impact</em> publication to be
      one that has been cited 10 or more times, then I have high-impact
      publications over the four decades of my academic career.

    <h2>2. By Decade of Publication</h2>

    <div class=content>
    
      <p>
      <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> shows the proportion of cites
      by decade of publication. Papers published in the 1980s were written
      during my undergraduate, graduate student, and Assistant Professor days.
      My first paper was published in 1983.
      The number of cites received 
      increased slowly as my interests shifted from parallel
      computation to neural networks.
      Publications in the 1990s started in neural networks and gradually
      shifted over to video game development, which remained my main interest
      for the next two decades.

      <p>
      <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> shows the highest number of cites (34&percnt;) came during the 2000s,
      and so you can say that that was the decade in which my research had the greatest impact.
      The 1990s come second with significantly fewer cites (25&percnt;), followed by the 1980s
      and 2010s (around 20&percnt; each).

      <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows that the 1980s was my least productive decade with
      20&percnt; of my cited publications and the 1990s was my most productive decade
      with 28&percnt; of my cited publications.
      The remaining decades saw 26&percnt; of my cited publications each, which is about
      what you would expect if cites were uniformly distributed over the decades (25&percnt;).

      A clearer picture emerges if you divide out the data used to produce 
      <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> and <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> to get the
      average number of cites per publication in each of the four decades,
      as shown in <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>. Therefore, we may
      conclude that my publications in the 2000s
      had the highest number of cites per paper, and therefore the highest impact per paper.
      The other entries in  <a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a> show a decline over time of the
      number of cites per paper, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the number
      of cites per paper increase with time, assuming that they stay relevant.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <ol>
      <li>
      If we define the <em>total impact</em> of a decade to be the total number of cites
      received for articles, papers, and books published during that time period, then
      my decade of highest total impact is 2000-2009.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      If we define the <em>production</em> of a decade to be the number of cited
      articles, papers, and books published during that time period, then
      my decade of lowest production is 1980-1989
      and during the three other decades my production varied by only 2&percnt;
      of my overall production

    <h2>3. By Subject</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
      <a href="sec2">Section 2</a> alludes to the fact that my publications can
      be grouped roughly by subject. In more detail, they can be broken
      up into four distinct areas:
      <em>neural networks</em> (including threshold circuits, Boltzmann machines,
      and Hopfield networks),
     <em>parallel computation</em>
      (including parallel complexity theory, circuit complexity, interconnection networks,
      routing, and sorting networks),
      <em>video games</em>
      (including procedural content generation),
      and <em>other</em>
      (including path planning, sequential algorithms and data structures,
      mathematical puzzles, and my guides for referees and presenting papers).
      Publications that fit into more than one of the above categories are
      placed arbitrarily into the first one into which it falls, which
      therefore make these categories non-overlapping.
      For example, threshold circuit complexity is included under neural networks,
      while circuit complexity using other types of gate are included under
      parallel computing.

      </div>
      
      While <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a> shows that my video game publications
      received more cites than any two of the three remaining categories combined,
      <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a> shows that I published more in the video game
      category than any other by quite a large margin.

      <p>
      According to <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>, my neural network publications (NN have
      a higher average number of cites per paper than the other three categories,
      followed pretty closely by my video game publications (VG).
      The two remaining categories in <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> are parallel computation (PC) and other (OT).

      If we define the <em>total impact</em> of a subject area to be the total number of cites

      my video game publications have the highest total impact.

      followed by my video game publications.
