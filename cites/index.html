    <h1>Citation Analysis</h1>
    
    <div class=content>
    <p>
    One method of measuring an academic publication's <em>impact</em> is to count the number
    of times it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation">cited</a> in other publications. Consequently, one way of measuring an academic scholar's <em>impact</em>
    is to statistically analyze the impact of their publications.
    This has resulted in the invention of various
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_index">citation indices</a>.
    However, these indices fail to answer important questions such as the following.
    </p>
    
    <ol>
    <li> How has the overall impact of my publications changed over time?
    (<a href="#sec1">Section 1</a>).
    <li> How is the per-publication impact distributed?
    (<a href="#sec2">Section 2</a>).
    <li> In which time period have I published things that have had the highest impact?
    (<a href="#sec3">Section 3</a>).
    <li> In which subject have my publications had the highest impact?
    (<a href="#sec4">Section 4</a>).
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      The following sections are a deeper analysis of my cites from 
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ZpdXNcAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>.

      <p>
      <a href="#fig1-1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows the number of cites that my
      publications received by year of citation. Since I started publishing
      about the time I received my PhD in 1984, the first cites appeared in 1984.
      <a href="#fig1-1">Fig. 1.1</a> shows a steady increase in cites during my tenure-track
      period, showing a peak in 1991 when I received tenure and another peak in 1994.
      Thereafter there is a steady decline to a low in 2004. This is probably because
      my interests switched from theoretical computer science to game development,
      necessitating a long period of retraining and concentration on teaching game
      programming. Besides, there was nowhere to publish video game research
      even if took it up.
      In the early 200s I took on Tim Roden as a PhD student. He turned me on to
      procedural content generation and from there to more research topics in
      game development. As we found new publication venues for this research,
      my cites rose from 2005 onwards to a level of about 150-180 per year.
      Other reasons for this noticable increase (compare the left-hand
      side of <a href="#fig1-1">Fig. 1.1</a> to the right-hand side)
      may be:
      <ol>
      <li> Everybody found the internet in the early 2000s.
      <li> Google Scholar became the place to find citation statistics,
      superceding the old CiteSeer software.
      <li> Conferences and workshops on video games started to appear.
      <li> Mainstream academic publications became more sympathetic to video game research.
      </ol>

      <a href="#fig1-2">Fig. 1.2</a> shows the number of cites that my
      publications received by decade of citation. The figure for the 1980s
      is low because I only started publishing mid-decade. Thereafter there is
      a solid increase from the 1990s to the 2010s. The figure for the 2020s
      looks like it may come close to matching the 2010s by the end of the decade.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <p>
     The impact of my publications was the highest from the mid-2000s onwards,
     which (perhaps coincidentally) began about the time I was promoted to Full Professor.

      <p>
      If we define a <em>high impact</em> publication to be
      one that has been cited 10 or more times, then I have high-impact
      publications over the four decades of my academic career.

      what you would expect if cites were uniformly distributed over the decades.

      A clearer picture emerges if you divide out the data used to produce 
      <a href="#fig3-1">Fig. 3.1</a> and <a href="#fig3-2">Fig. 3.2</a> to get the
      average number of cites per publication in each of the four decades,
      as shown in <a href="#fig3-3">Fig. 3.3</a>. Therefore, we may
      conclude that my publications in the 2010s
      had the highest number of cites per paper, and hence the highest impact per paper.
      </p>  
      
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      
      <ol>
      <li>
      If we define the <em>total impact</em> of a decade to be the total number of cites
      received for publications during that time period, then
      my total impact has increased over time.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      If we define the <em>productivity</em> of a decade to be the number of cited
      publications during that time period, then
      my productivity has increased or remained steady over time.
      </li>
      
      <li>
      If we define the <em>average impact</em> of a decade to be the average number of cites
      received for publications during that time period, then
      my average impact shows only a slight decrease over time,
      which is to be expected because things that were published recently
      have had less time to be cited than those that were published before them,
      with an increase in the 2010s which may be due to the subject matter.

    <h2>4. By Subject Area</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
      <a href="#sec3">Section 3</a> alludes to the fact that my publications can
      be grouped roughly by subject. In more detail, they can be broken
      up into five areas:
      <em>neural networks</em> (including threshold circuits, Boltzmann machines,
      and Hopfield networks),
     <em>parallel computation</em>
      (including parallel complexity theory, circuit complexity, interconnection networks,
      routing, and sorting networks),
      <em>video games</em>
      (including procedural content generation),
      <em>algorithms</em (including algorithm design and analysis)
      and <em>other</em>
      (including my guides for referees and presenting papers).
      Publications that fit into more than one of the above categories are
      placed somewhat arbitrarily into the one that I think is best.
      For example, threshold circuit complexity is included under neural networks,
      while circuit complexity using other types of gate are included under
      parallel computing.

      While <a href="#fig4-1">Fig. 4.1</a> shows that my video game publications
      received more cites than any two of the remaining categories combined,
      <a href="#fig4-2">Fig. 4.2</a> shows that I published more in the video game
      category than any other by quite a large margin.

      According to <a href="#fig4-3">Fig. 4.3</a>, my
      video game (VG), and algorithms (AL)
      publications have
      a higher average number of cites per paper than the other categories,  neural network (NN),
