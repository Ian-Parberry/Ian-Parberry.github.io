    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      We describe an algorithm for the procedural generation of
      levels for the popular Japanese puzzle game Sokoban. The
      algorithm takes a few parameters and builds a random instance
      of the puzzle that is guaranteed to be solvable. Although
      our algorithm and its implementation runs in exponential
      time, we present experimental evidence that it is
      sufficiently fast for offine use on a current generation PC
      when used to generate levels of size and complexity similar
      to those human-designed levels currently available online.

  <h2>What is Sokoban?</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.sokoban.jp/">Sokoban</a> (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a top-down puzzle
      in which the player pushes boxes around a grid into specially marked destinations.
      Only one box may be pushed at a time, and boxes cannot be pulled.
      For example, the image at right shows how to move a single box to the destination location, which
      is marked with a cross in the top left corner. The player is represented by the yellow bulldozer. See
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">the Wikipedia article</a>
      and the <a href="http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Sokoban Wiki</a>
      for more information about this game.
    </p>

    <p>
      To play it yourself, download (for example) <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsokoapplet/">JSoko</a>,
      an open source Java implementation of Sokoban. The screenshots in this webpage were taken from JSoko.
      (Disclaimer: We are not the creators of JSoko, and therefore cannot be held responsible for its content.)

  <h2>Four Levels Solved</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      The following video shows four levels generated by our procedural generator being solved using JSoko's autosolver.
      These are not necessarily the best solutions, nor are they the best possible,
      but they are certainly plausible and give some indication of the difficulty of
      the levels.

  <h2>Try Our Procedurally Generated Level Sets</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      The following level sets were created by our generator.
      Each one starts with easy (sometimes trivial) instances, and gets harder with each one
      you solve.
      To try it out for yourself,
      first install <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsokoapplet/">JSoko</a> if you haven't already, then download one
      or more of the files below
      into your JSoko folder.
      (Note that each level set below is a <a href="http://sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format">human-readable text file</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      In JSoko, select Load Level from the menu bar, then External Level.
      You will see a dialog box containing a list of files. Select one, click the Open
      button, and start playing.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href=level1.txt>Level Set 1 (level1.txt)</a>
      <li>
        <a href=level2.txt>Level Set 2 (level2.txt)</a>
      <li>
        <a href=level3.txt>Level Set 3 (level3.txt)</a>
      <li>
        <a href=level4.txt>Level Set 4 (level4.txt)</a>
      <li>
        <a href=level5.txt>Level Set 5 (level5.txt)</a>
    </ul>
