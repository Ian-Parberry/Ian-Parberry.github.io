    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Perlin noise is often used to compute a regularly spaced grid of noise values. The amortized
      noise algorithm takes advantage of this regular call pattern to amortize the computation cost of
      floating-point computations over interpolated points using dynamic programming techniques.
      The 2D amortized noise algorithm uses a factor of 17/3 &asymp; 5.67 fewer floating-point multiplications
      than the 2D Perlin noise algorithm, resulting in a speedup by a factor of approximately
      3.6-4.8 in practice on available desktop and laptop computing hardware. The 3D amortized
      noise algorithm uses a factor of 40/7 &asymp; 5.71 fewer floating-point multiplications than the 3D
      Perlin noise algorithm; however, the increasing overhead for the initialization of tables limits
      the speedup factor achieved in practice to around 2.25. Improvements to both 2D Perlin
      noise and 2D amortized noise include making them infinite and non-repeating by replacing the
      permutation table with a perfect hash function, and making them smoother by using quintic
      splines instead of cubic splines. While these improvements slow down 2D Perlin noise down
      by a factor of approximately 32-92, they slow 2D amortized noise by a negligible amount.

    <p>
      These animated gifs were created by taking 128 slices across a 256x256x256
      block of 3D noise with 5 octaves
      generated by the amortized 3D noise algorithm.
      The result is similar to 3D Perlin noise,
      but it does not repeat at regular intervals,
      and it is smoother since it uses a quintic spline instead
      of a cubic spline.
      The image on the left shows -1 as black, +1 as white, and values
      in between as shades of gray. The image on the right shows
      negative values as purple and non-negative values as green.
