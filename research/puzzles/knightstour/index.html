  <h1>Some Closed Knight's Tours</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      A <em>cyclic knight's tour</em> is a sequence of knight's moves that
      visit every square of an <em>n</em> x <em>n</em> chessboard, returning to
      the first square.
      These are some images from <a href="/">Ian Parberry</a>'s
      research on cyclic knight's tours in the 1990s. See <a href="..">these papers</a>
      for more information. Some of the tours are generated by a random walk,
      one is generated by a neural network, some are generated by a divide-and-conquer
      algorithm that gives the tours a tiled look. Some are symmetric under rotations.

  <h2>6x6, Random</h2>

    <p>
      The following small knight's
      tour was used as part of the base of the recursion
      in a divide-and-conquer algorithm described in
      <a href="/">Ian Parberry</a>,
      "An Efficient Algorithm for the Knight's Tour Problem",
      <cite>Discrete Applied Mathematics</cite>, Vol. 73, pp. 251-260, 1997.

      You may have noticed by now that all of the closed knight's tours you
      have seen so far (6x6, 8x8, and 10x10) have even sides. That's because there
      can be no knight's tours on an odd-sided board (to see this,
      consider the fact that on a real chessboard, the squares visited in
      a knight's tour must alternate
      between black and white).

      Closed knight's that are invariant under a 90&deg; rotation exist on nxn boards
      for all even n at least 6 that is not divisible by 4 (Dejter, 1983). This tour is from
