  <h1>Mathematical Puzzles</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
     Like most geeks I have a casual interest in mathematical puzzles.
     The ones that I've had the most interest in over the years include
     <a href="/rubikscube">Rubik's cube</a>,
      the knight's tour problem, and the $(n^2-1)$-puzzle.
      Only some of those research projects bore fruit, the results of which you can see below.
      My coauthors in some of this work include colleague Ingo Wegener and his
      then student Oleg Kyek.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      New algorithms for generating closed knight's tours 
are obtained by generating a vertex-disjoint cycle cover of the knight's graph and joining the resulting cycles. It is shown experimentally that these algorithms are significantly faster in practice than previous methods. A fast obfuscation algorithm for closed knight's tours that obscures obvious artifacts created by their method of generation is also given, along
with visual and statistical evidence of its efficacy.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      While the 15-puzzle has a long and interesting history dating back to the 1870s,
      it still continues to appear as
      apps on mobile devices and as minigames inside larger video games.
      We demonstrate a method for solving the 15-puzzle
      using only 4.7MB of tables
      that on a million random instances was able to
      find solutions of 65 moves on average and
      95 moves in the worst case in under a tenth of a millisecond per solution
      on current desktop computing hardware.
      These numbers compare favorably to the worst-case upper bound of 80 moves
      and to the greedy algorithm published in 1995, which required
      118 moves on average and
      195 moves in the worst case.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      It is shown that the greedy algorithm for the \((n^2-1)\)-puzzle
      makes \(\tfrac{8}{3}n^3 +O(n^2)\) expected moves.
      This analysis is verified experimentally on 10,000 random
      instances each of the \((n^2-1)\)-puzzle for \(4 \leq n \leq 200\).

    <p>
      Knight's tours are a fascinating subject. New lower bounds on the number of knight's tours
      and structured knight's tours on $n \times  n$ chessboards and even $n$ are presented. For the natural
      special case $n = 8$ a new upper bound is proved.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      A real-time algorithm for the $(n^2-1)$-puzzle is designed using greedy and divide-and-conquer
      techniques. It is proved that (ignoring lower order terms) the new
      algorithm uses at most $5n^3$ moves, and that any such algorithm must make at least
      $n^3$ moves in the worst case, at least $2n^3/3$ moves on average, and with probability
      one, at least $0.264n^3$ moves on random configurations.
