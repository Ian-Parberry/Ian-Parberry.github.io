  <h1>Sorting Networks</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      Sorting networks fascinate me.
      They even got me mentioned in Knuth Vol. 3,
      <a href="images/knuth666.jpg">p. 666</a> of the second edition.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      A new sorting network with exactly the same size and depth as the odd-even sorting
      network is presented. This sorting network is designed using the zero-one principle,
      and proceeds by first sorting pairs of bits and sorting the pairs
      into lexicographic order.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      A sorting network is a combinational circuit for sorting, constructed from comparison-swap units.
      The depth of such a circuit is a measure of its running time. It is reasonable to hypothesize that only
      the fastest (that is, the shallowest) networks are likely to be fabricated. It is shown that the problem
      of verifying that a given sorting network actually sorts is Co-NP complete even for sorting networks of
      depth only $4 \log n + O(1)$ greater than optimal. This is shallower than previous depth bounds by a
      factor of two.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      A <em>sorting network</em> is a combinational circuit for sorting constructed from comparison-swap units.
      The <em>depth</em> of such a circuit is a measure of its running time. It is known that
      sorting-network verification is computationally intractable. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize
      that only the fastest (that is, the shallowest) networks are likely to be fabricated. It is shown
      that the verification of shallow sorting networks is also computationally intractable. Firstly, a method
      for constructing asymptotically optimal single-exception sorting networks is demonstrated.
      These are networks which sort all zero-one inputs except one. More specifically, their depth
      is $D(n-1)+2\log (n-1)+2$, where $D(n)$ is the minimum depth of an $n$-input sorting network. It
      follows that the verification problem for sorting networks of depth
      $2D(n) + 6 \log n + O(1)$ is Co-NP complete. Given the current state of knowledge about $D(n)$ for large
      $n$, this indicates that the complexity of verification for shallow sorting networks
      is as great as for deep networks

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      It is demonstrated, using a combination of theoretical and experimental computer
      science, that there is no nine-input sorting network of depth six. If a nine-input sorting
      network of depth six exists, then there exists one with very special structure. There is
      an efficient algorithm for constructing and testing comparator networks of this form.
      This algorithm was implemented and executed on a supercomputer.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      We study the problem of using sorters of $k$ values to form large sorting and
      merging networks. For $n$ an integral power of
      $k$, we show how to merge $k$ sorted vectors of length $n/k$ each using $4 \log_k n - 3$ layers
      of $k$-sorters and $4 \log_k n - 5$ layers of
      k-input binary mergers. As a result, we show how to sort n values
      using $2 \log_k^2 n - \log_k n$ layers of $k$-sorters and
      $2 \log_k^2 n - 3 \log_k n + 1$ layers of $k$-input binary mergers.
