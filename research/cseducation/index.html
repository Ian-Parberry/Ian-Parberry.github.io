    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Computer science courses have increasingly made use of visualization tools to illustrate common algorithms.
      This paper describes Algorithm Explorer, an educational tool designed for use by instructors and students
      to examine algorithms in a rich environment composed of 3D data representations,
      3D audio cues, and easy-to-use controls.  Instructors and students can easily add calls to Algorithm Explorer's
      C++ API to their programs to quickly develop engaging visualizations, and every detail of the scene can
      be customized as the developer desires.

    <h3>From the Preface</h3>

    <p>
      These lecture notes are almost exact copies of the overhead projector transparencies that I use in my CSCI
      4450 course (Algorithm Analysis and Complexity Theory) at the University of North Texas. The material
      comes from
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        textbooks on algorithm design and analysis,
      <li>
        textbooks on other subjects,
      <li>
        research monographs,
      <li>
        papers in research journals and conferences, and
      <li>
        my own knowledge and experience.
    </ul>

    <p>
      Be forewarned, this is not a textbook, and is not designed to be read like a textbook. To get the best use
      out of it you must attend my lectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students entering this course are expected to be able to program in some procedural programming language
      such as C or C++, and to be able to deal with discrete mathematics. Some familiarity with basic data
      structures and algorithm analysis techniques is also assumed. For those students who are a little rusty, I
      have included some basic material on discrete mathematics and data structures, mainly at the start of the
      course, partially scattered throughout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why did I take the time to prepare these lecture notes? I have been teaching this course (or courses very
      much like it) at the undergraduate and graduate level since 1985. Every time I teach it I take the time to
      improve my notes and add new material. In Spring Semester 1992 I decided that it was time to start doing
      this electronically rather than, as I had done up until then, using handwritten and xerox copied notes that
      I transcribed onto the chalkboard during class.

    <p>
      <a href="/">I. Parberry</a>,
      <cite>Problems on Algorithms</cite>, Prentice Hall, 1995.
      Second Edition, with William Gasarch, 2002.

    </p>

    <h3>From the Preface</h3>

    <p>
      The ability to devise effective and efficient algorithms in new situations
      is a skill that separates the master programmer from the merely adequate coder.
      The best way to develop that skill is to solve problems.
      To be effective problem solvers, master-programmers-in-training must
      do more than memorize a collection of standard techniques and applications
      - they must in addition be able to internalize and integrate what they have
      learned and apply it in new circumstances.
      This book is a collection of problems on the design, analysis,
      and verification of algorithms for use
      by practicing programmers who wish to hone and expand their skills,
      as a supplementary text for students enrolled in an
      undergraduate or beginning graduate class on algorithms, and
      as a self-study text
      for graduate students who are preparing for the qualifying (often
      called "breadth" or "comprehensive") examination on algorithms for
      a Ph.D. program in Computer Science or Computer Engineering.
      It is intended to augment the problem sets
      found in any standard algorithms textbook.

      <a href="/">I. Parberry</a>,
      "SIGACT Trying to Get Children Excited About CS", <em>Computing Research News</em>, Vol. 5, No. 1, p. 7, Jan. 1993.

    <h3>From the Preamble</h3>

    <p>
      As an emerging discipline, computer
      science has a serious communication
      problem. The public generally is
      ignorant of what computer science is
      and what computer scientists do. They
      tend to hear the word "computer" and
      assume that we are some kind of
      technicians. Is it any wonder then that
      computer science is represented in
      many schools by either computer games
      or some antiquated approach to
      programming, which at worst concentrates on a litany of syntax and at best
      emphasizes expediency over effectiveness and efficiency?
      But computer science
      is not about computers - it is
      about computation.

    <h3>Author's Comments</h3>

    <p>
      There's a quote in this article that is often attributed to Edsger Dijkstra.
    </p>

    <div class=blockquote>
      "Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy
      is about telescopes"
    </div>

    <p>
      It appears twice in our article (see the <a href="/pubs/crn1993.pdf">pdf</a>
      and the images below), once in the running text, and once in a breakout box with
      "Computer science" abbreviated to "CS".
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Our quote." src="images/ourquote.png">


    <p>
      My coauthor Mike Fellows made a similar statement on p.2 of
      a <a href="fellows1991.pdf">1991 paper</a> (the italics are his):
    </p>

    <div class=blockquote>
      "Computer science is not about machines, in the same way that astronomy is not
      <em>about telescopes</em>"
    </div>

    <p>
      Dijkstra visited the University of Victoria in 1991 or 1992
      (Mike's memory is unclear on the exact year),
      where Mike enthused to him about the MegaMath project
      over dinner.  According to Mike, the quote in question was a rallying cry in that period.
      Mike is responsible for writing
      "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes" in the draft
      of our 1993 article. I added the afterthought "...biology is about microscopes
      or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes."
    </p>

    <p>
      Consulting the extensive
      <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/">archive of Dijkstra's manuscripts at UT Austin</a>,
      Dijkstra's use of the quote appears to be from a
      <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/video-audio/NoorderlichtVideo.html">video made in Fall 2000</a>
      for Dutch television, broadcast in April 2001.
      His quote appears at about 1:33 into the video, screenshots of which are given below.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Dijkstra quote." src="images/dijkstra.png">

    <p>
      I believe that Dijkstra's quote should be attributed to Mike Fellows, since it
      is fairly clear that Dijkstra heard
      it from him. Although the earliest appearance
      in print appears to be in our 1993 article,  in my opinion Mike deserves sole attribution.
      He made up the part that is quoted so widely.
      I simply tacked on a bit at the
      end that nobody bothers to quote.
      Here it is again, correctly attributed for posterity.
