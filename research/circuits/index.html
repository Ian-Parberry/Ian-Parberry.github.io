  <h1>Circuit Complexity</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      I got interested in circuit complexity in 1981 in Australia
      by working for a semester
      as Les Goldschlager's research assistant,
      during which we worked out the details of the first paper below.
      I carried that interest into my PhD thesis
      and on into the 1990s. Some of the papers in
      <a href="../neuralnets">Neural Networks</a>
      and <a href="../parallel">Parallel Computing</a>
      also have some circuit complexity in them too, so in spite of the fact that there
      are only two papers listed below, circuit complexity was clearly
      a thread that I followed for much of the 20th Century.
      My coauthors in
      this work include
      Les Goldschlager and
      my Penn State <a href="/phd.html">PhD student</a>
      Peiyuan Yan.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Exponential size lower bounds are obtained for some depth three
      circuits computing conjunction using one layer each of
      gates which compute Boolean functions of
      low total degree when expressed as polynomials,
      parity-modulo-2 gates, and parity-modulo-q gates, where q is prime.
      One of these results implies a special case of the
      <em>constant degree hypothesis</em> of Barrington et al.
      The lower bounds are obtained from
      an algebraic characterization of the functions computed by the circuits:
      it is shown that certain integer multiples of these functions
      can be expressed as the sum of a lattice element
      and a function of small value.
      It is conjectured that this characterization
      can be used to resolve the constant degree hypothesis.

    <p>
      Yan and I were certain we were on the threshold of something deep here, 
      but we never were able to push these results any further than this.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      The effects of bases of two-input Boolean functions are characterized
      in terms of their impact on some questions in parallel computation.  It
      is found that a certain set of bases (called the P-complete set), which
      are not necessarily complete in the classical sense, apparently makes
      the circuit value problem difficult, and renders extended Turing machines
      and networks of Boolean gates equal to general parallel
      computers.  A class of problems
      called EP arises naturally from this study, relating to the parity of the
      number of solutions to a problem, in contrast to previously defined
      classes concerning the count of the number of solutions (#P) or the
      existence of solutions (NP).  Tournament isomorphism is a member of EP.

    <h3>Author's Comment</h3>

    <p>
      I contributed to this paper while employed 
      as Les Goldschlager's Research Assistant in 1981.
      I believe that the Technical Report version was typed up by a human being on an actual
      electric typewriter. Things were a lot slower in those days.
      That probably explains why it took 5 years to get into print.
      One of the contributions of this paper is the independent discovery of the complexity class
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_P">parity-P</a>.
      Not that Les and I get much credit for it.
