    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      New algorithms for generating closed knight's tours 
are obtained by generating a vertex-disjoint cycle cover of the knight's graph and joining the resulting cycles. It is shown experimentally that these algorithms are significantly faster in practice than previous methods. A fast obfuscation algorithm for closed knight's tours that obscures obvious artifacts created by their method of generation is also given, along
with visual and statistical evidence of its efficacy.

  <p>
      The cross-platform open-source 
      tourney generator available from the github link below contains an implementation of the
	  algorithms described in the paper. It will generate closed knight's tours and tourneys
	  in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format which can be viewed in a browser,
      reproduce the reported move and relative move frequency statistics, and
      measure run time requirements. The latter will, of course vary from the ones
	  reported in the paper depending on the computational
	  power of the computer on which it is executed.

  <h2>Obfuscating Warnsdorf Tours</h2>
  
  <div class=content>
    <p>
      Knight's tours generated by Warnsdorf's algorithm  can be recognized by
      the regions of parallel moves created by Warnsdorf's heuristic, which causes
      the knight to prefer to stay close to where it has been before. This can be seen quite clearly in the image below.
    </p>
  
    <img class="centered" width="80%" src="images/WarnsdJoin50.svg" alt="50x50 Warnsdorf tour.">
  <div class="centered">
    50x50 Warnsdorf tour
    (<a href="images/WarnsdJoin50.txt">move table</a>).
  </div>
  
    <p>
    In contrast, Takefuji and Lee's neural network generates knight's tours that appear more locally random.

    <p>
    Obfuscating a Warnsdorf tour minimizes the visual artifacts introduced by Warnsdorf's heuristic.

  <h2>Large Knight's Tours</h2>
  
  <div class=content>
    <p>
    Previously, the only computationally feasible way to construct a 
    large knight's tour was to generate one that is highly structured
    using, for example, divide-and conquer
    (such as this 200x200 example: <a href="images/DivideTour200.svg">image</a>, 
    <a href="images/DivideTour200.txt">move table</a>).
    The obfuscation algorithm described in this paper allows us to generate
    large knight's tours of sizes much larger than is computationally
    feasible using Warnsdorf's algorithm or the Takefuji-Lee algorithm.
    The images can be examined in more detail using your browser's zoom function.
	Very large knight's tours are provided as zip files for convenience.

      (<a href="images/BraidJoinBlur200.svg">image</a>,

    </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2>More Braided Tourneys</h2>
  
  <div class=content>
    <p>
      There are potentially many more types of braided tourney than the concentric braided tourney described in the paper. Here are some examples.
    Colors are used to indicate the four cycles that comprise each braid.
