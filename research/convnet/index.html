    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
    Audio upscaling with generative neural networks has been studied in the fields of super-resolution and speech bandwidth expansion. Previous approaches have worked well for speech, but not for music. We propose a DNN approach with a novel dilated and residual architecture for this domain and an additional refinement method which outperforms other methods when upscaling music according to the log RMS spectral distance error metric.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
We examine a recently developed system for censorship and surveillance resistant communication within a censored region which uses online games as a cover. This system works by embedding information directly into the game network traffic, and demonstrates resistance to current detection methods. We propose a novel approach to detect the use of such a system by comparing attributes of the prediction accuracy of a sequence-predictive convolutional neural network trained on altered and unaltered signals. Our method is able to to reliably detect the presence of alteration of data within a reasonably small window of a multi-featured signal from a parametric signal generator.
