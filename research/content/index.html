  <h1>Procedural Content Generation</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      <em>Procedural content generation</em> is the automatic creation of video game content, where
      <em>content</em> means anything that is traditionally created by an artist or a designer,
      such
      as maps, textures, levels, and objects.
      Content creation usually requires equal parts creativity and scutwork.
      The aim of procedural content generation is to
      relieve the designer of the scutwork in ways that create more
      opportunities for creativity.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Modular bivariate quadratic functions
      are used to procedurally generate textures that resemble
      ornamentation, skin, scales, feathers, and textiles.
      They are easy to implement and particularly suited to parallel execution as a pixel shader.
      A prototype browser-based procedural texture generator
      with an interface suitable for use by non-mathematicians
      such as designers and artists is described.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      We describe a framework for executing procedurally
      generated quests implemented in the MMORPG Everquest using the Open
      Source EQEmu Everquest server. Quests play out at run-time
      using a collection of <em>triggers</em>, which consist of a testable game
      state condition and a script that is to be run when the condition is
      satisfied. We describe the interface between the quest generator and
      the server which enables the seamless integration of the procedurally generated quests
      within the existing server architecture.  To demonstrate
      how this process takes place in real time,
      we analyze a nontrivial procedurally generated quest and
      describe the key server-controlled actions that derive from it.

      A statistical analysis of elevation data from a 160,000 square kilometer region
      finds that terrain gradients
      appear to be exponentially distributed at all horizontal resolutions.
      Simple modifications to the Perlin noise algorithm and

      distribution in each octave to an exponential distribution,
      resulting in varied and interesting procedurally generated terrain.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Perlin noise is often used to compute a regularly spaced grid of noise values. The amortized
      noise algorithm takes advantage of this regular call pattern to amortize the computation cost of
      floating-point computations over interpolated points using dynamic programming techniques.
      The 2D amortized noise algorithm uses a factor of 17/3 &asymp; 5.67 fewer floating-point multiplications
      than the 2D Perlin noise algorithm, resulting in a speedup by a factor of approximately
      3.6-4.8 in practice on available desktop and laptop computing hardware. The 3D amortized
      noise algorithm uses a factor of 40/7 &asymp; 5.71 fewer floating-point multiplications than the 3D
      Perlin noise algorithm; however, the increasing overhead for the initialization of tables limits
      the speedup factor achieved in practice to around 2.25. Improvements to both 2D Perlin
      noise and 2D amortized noise include making them infinite and non-repeating by replacing the
      permutation table with a perfect hash function, and making them smoother by using quintic
      splines instead of cubic splines. While these improvements slow down 2D Perlin noise down
      by a factor of approximately 32-92, they slow 2D amortized noise by
      a negligible amount.
    </p>

    <h3>Author's Comments</h3>
    <p>
      What has this to do with procedural content generation you may ask?
      Well, Perlin noise is usually the go-to algorithm for generating
      smooth random noise for procedural content such as textures.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      The standard way to procedurally generate random terrain for
      video games and other applications is to post-process the output of a fast noise
      generator such as Perlin Noise.
      Tuning the post-processing to achieve particular types of terrain requires
      game designers to be reasonably well-trained in
      mathematics.
      We describe how a well-known variant of Perlin Noise called <em>Value Noise</em>
      can be used by a designer trained in geography to generate
      geotypical terrain based on elevation statistics drawn from widely available
      sources such as the United States Geographical Service.

      We present a method for simulating the melting and flowing of material
      in burning objects fast enough to be of use in video games where most
      of the graphical and computational resources are needed elsewhere.
      The standard practice of using particle engines or fluid dynamics
      for melting are far too costly for use in this environment.
      We demonstrate that our method, which is based on systematic
      polygonal expanding and folding, uses only a fraction of the
      computational power available by implementing the computation
      on a very modest GPU using CUDA.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Objects in 3D games are typically shell models, a polygon mesh
      representing the shell or skin of the object. While emulation
      of the behaviour of shell models under combustion is sufficient
      for many game applications and is fairly well studied, solid objects
      do in fact burn rather differently than shell objects. We show how
      to manipulate shell models so that they appear to burn as solid models.
      Since our burning objects will be only a small part of a video game,
      computation speed is of the essence. We demonstrate that our method uses
      only a fraction of the computational power available by implementing
      the computation on a modest GPU using CUDA.

    <p>
      Computer role playing games, particularly those with persistent worlds, often allow players
      to buy and sell goods and services with computer controlled non-player characters (NPCs).
      The prices for these goods and services are often determined a priori, and remain fixed for the
      game's duration. As a result, prices do not respond to changes in supply and demand, nor does
      supply and demand respond to changes in prices. We present an economic model suitable for
      use with role playing games that will automatically determine prices for multiple goods, supply
      and demand for each character, and an allocation of agents to roles that is sustainable given the
      state of the game.

      Deformation of the low-polygon models used in in video games is challenging since it is hard to maintain realism.
      We show how real-time mesh refinement can be used for modeling the deformation and consumption of
      low-polygon models under combustion while generating procedural fire. Our focus is on trading realism
      for computation speed so that processing power is still available for other
      computational tasks. Our method also allows for quick and easy LOD (level-of-detail) rendering
      of burning objects. We have implemented and tested our method on a relatively modest GPU using CUDA.
      Our experiments suggest that our method gives a believable rendering of the effects of fire while
      using only a small fraction of CPU and GPU resources.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      We describe real time dynamic wind calculation for a pressure
      driven wind system. This simple and elegant approach allows us
      to perform visual effects in real time using a minute fraction of the
      CPU's processing power over and above what is required for static
      wind. Experiments were performed with a real-time application to
      render wind-driven snow over a 3D terrain to verify these claims.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Real-time virtual reality applications, including games, increasingly use outdoor environments.
      A common task in an earth-type environment is to render a sky that is
      realistic both in terms of imagery and physics. Programmable graphics hardware offers the
      opportunity to procedurally generate and render a highly realistic sky at a minimal cost.
      We propose an integrated set of efficient algorithms that run in graphics hardware for interactive
      sky rendering that is fully parameterized for real-time control. Features of our method include
      multi-layered dynamic clouds and stars that individually flicker at
      varying intensity and rate.

      <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Traditionally, a typical 3D game development project proceeds concurrently on two fronts.
      Programmers design, code and test a game engine at the same time that artists create content for the game.
      There are compelling reasons to suggest that this paradigm may no longer
      be desirable or even feasible for some projects. Technical advances in hardware have enabled
      the use of art assets that are much more detailed than ever before. Increased storage and available
      RAM translates into larger game worlds. Some games require an enormous amount of
      content such as online multiplayer games and games that aim to provide a high level of replay.
      Still another factor is the increased availability of licensed engines and other high
      quality middleware which can cut engine development time significantly. What this means is high definition
      art assets, which take artists longer to create, will likely be needed sooner rather
      than later in the development cycle. One obvious solution to this problem
      is to create art assets procedurally. This gem presents the ideas and techniques behind a procedural level
      generator. We illustrate its use to create a simple 3D dungeon.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Procedural techniques will soon automate many aspects of content creation for computer games.
      We describe an efficient, deterministic, methodology for procedurally generating 3D game content
      of arbitrary size and complexity. The technique progressively amplifies simple
      dynamically generated data structures into complex geometry. We use a procedural pipeline with
      a minimum set of controls at each stage to facilitate authoring. We show two examples from our research.
      Our terrain generator can synthesize massive 3D terrains in real-time while our level generator can
      be used to create indoor environments offline or in real-time.
