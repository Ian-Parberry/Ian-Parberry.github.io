    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      While the 15-puzzle has a long and interesting history dating back to the 1870s,
      it still continues to appear as
      apps on mobile devices and as minigames inside larger video games.
      We demonstrate a method for solving the 15-puzzle
      using only 4.7MB of tables
      that on a million random instances was able to
      find solutions of 65 moves on average and
      95 moves in the worst case in under a tenth of a millisecond per solution
      on current desktop computing hardware.
      These numbers compare favorably to the worst-case upper bound of 80 moves
      and to the greedy algorithm published in 1995, which required
      118 moves on average and
      195 moves in the worst case.

        In the following animations, the left-hand board
        shows the solution found by the greedy algorithm from
        my 1995 paper,
        while the right-hand board shows the much shorter solution found by the new algorithm.
