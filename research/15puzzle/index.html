    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      While the 15-puzzle has a long and interesting history dating back to the 1870s,
      it still continues to appear as
      apps on mobile devices and as minigames inside larger video games.
      We demonstrate a method for solving the 15-puzzle
      using only 4.7MB of tables
      that on a million random instances was able to
      find solutions of 65 moves on average and
      95 moves in the worst case in under a tenth of a millisecond per solution
      on current desktop computing hardware.
      These numbers compare favorably to the worst-case upper bound of 80 moves
      and to the greedy algorithm published in 1995, which required
      118 moves on average and
      195 moves in the worst case.

  <h1>Try It Out</h1>

    <p>
      My PhD student Josh Taylor translated my C++ into ActionScript and produced the Flash
      animation below.
      If you are on one of those devices that don't allow Flash, you'll have to content yourself
      with the animated gifs in the next section.

    <p>
      Hit the space bar to scramble the tiles, and hit the Enter key to
      start solving. You can hit space or Enter at any time to stop the animation.

    <h1>Examples</h1>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
        In the following animations, the left-hand board
        shows the solution found by the greedy algorithm from
        my 1995 paper,
        while the right-hand board shows the much shorter solution found by the new algorithm.
