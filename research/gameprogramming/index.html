    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      The widespread use of sophisticated mobile computing devices has set the
      stage for a renaissance in audio only entertainment. Traditional 
      visual games are already used widely in cellular phones and similar devices.
      A significant limitation is the small display size. In contrast, audio only
      games on suitable mobile hardware need not degrade due to the smaller form
      factor. This makes audio only games an attractive alternative to visual games.
      We describe a framework for authoring interactive narrative-based audio only
      games set in 3D virtual environments. Despite the novelty in audio only gaming,
      our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio
      only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and
      human-computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a
      realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion
      and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games practical
      for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay
      and multiplayer support. We also describe our software architecture, the 
      current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware
      and software. In addition, we describe our first game, Dragon's Roar.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      We describe a simple and efficient dynamic occlusion culling algorithm
      for computing potentially visible sets (PVS) in densely occluded
      virtual environments. Our method is an optimization of a widely used
      technique in which a 3D environment is divided into cells and portals.
      Our algorithm computes the PVS in approximately half the time of previous
      portal methods at the expense of producing a slightly relaxed PVS.
      In addition, our algorithm enables fast culling of objects within cells
      using inexpensive object space methods by using a lookup table to compute
      the diminished object space view frustum. The algorithm takes advantage
      of temporal coherence, is easy to implement, and is particularly well suited
      for applications that need to compute a PVS for use in non-rendering tasks such as AI.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Subhunt is a 2.5D, sprite based, real-time, first-person, single-player
      submarine action game produced by faculty and students at the University
      of North Texas.  Players find themselves piloting a submarine with the
      task of locating and destroying enemy shipping while managing critical
      resources and trying not to get killed.  Visual and audio cues create the
      illusion of action that allows the player to become completely immersed
      in the Subhunt virtual world.

    <h3>Author's Comment</h3>

    <p>
      We couldn't find any place to publish this in 1997. After all, it reads more like
      a manual than an academic paper. Pity.
