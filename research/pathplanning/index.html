  <h1>Path Planning</h1>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      When Ki-Yin Chang from the Department of Merchant Marine at the National Taiwan Ocean University visited my lab for a year in 2002,
      we did some work on a variant of
      Dijkstra's algorithm on a 2D grid graph with diagonal connections,
      and some variations thereof. This led to four journal papers in
      three different application domains (navigation,
      design automation, and mechatronics) where this apparently
      was a new and interesting idea.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Some optimal path planning algorithms for navigatingmobile
      rectangular robot among obstacles and weighted regions
      are presented. The approach is based on a higher geometry maze
      routing algorithm. Starting from a top view of a workspace with
      obstacles, the so-called free workspace is first obtained by virtually
      expanding the obstacles in the image. After that, an 8-geomerty
      maze routing algorithm is applied to obtain an optimal collisionfree
      path with linear time and space complexities. The proposed
      methods cannot only search an optimal path among various terrains
      but also find an optimal path for the 2-D piano mover’s
      problem with 3 DOF. Furthermore, the algorithm can be easily extended
      to the dynamic collision avoidance problem among multiple
      autonomous robots or path planning in the 3-D space.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      This article presents efficient and practical methods for path planning of optimal interceptions
      on two-dimensional grids with obstacles, such as raster charts or non-distorted digital
      maps. The proposed methods search for optimal paths from sources to multiple movingtargets
      by a novel higher geometry wave propagation scheme in the grids, instead of the
      traditional vector scheme in the graphs. By introducing a time-matching scheme, the optimal
      interception paths from sources to all the moving-targets are obtained among the combinations
      with linear time and space complexities. Two optimal path planning methods for
      multiple one-to-one interceptions, the MIN-MAX and MIN-AVG, are applied to emulate
      the real routing.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      The maze routing problem is to find an optimal path between a given pair of cells on a grid plane.
      Lee’s algorithm and its variants, probably the most widely used maze routing method, fails to
      work in the 4-geometry of the grid plane. Our algorithm solves this problem by using a suitable
      data structure for uniform wave propagation in the 4-geometry, 8-geometry, etc. The algorithm
      guarantees finding an optimal path if it exists and has linear time and space complexities.
      Next, to solve the obstacle-avoiding rectilinear and 4-geometry Steiner tree problems, a heuristic
      algorithm is presented. The algorithm utilizes a cost accumulation scheme based on the maze
      router to determine the Torricelli vertices (points) for improving the quality of multiterminal nets.
      Our experimental results show that the algorithm works well in practice. Furthermore, using the
      4-geometry router, path lengths can be significantly reduced up to 12\% compared to those in the
      rectilinear router.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      Collision avoidance is an intensive discussion issue for navigation safety. This article introduces
      a new routing algorithm for finding optimal routes with collision detection and
      avoidance on raster charts or planes. After the required data structure of the raster chart is
      initialized, the maze routing algorithm is applied to obtain the particular route of each ship.
      Those ships that have potential to collide will be detected by simulating the particular routes
      with ship domains. The collision avoidance scheme can be achieved by using the collision area
      marking method with collision avoidance rules at sea. The algorithm has linear time and
      space complexities, and is sufficiently fast to perform real-time routing on the raster charts.
