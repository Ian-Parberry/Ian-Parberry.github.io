  <h1>Straight Line Curves</h1>

  <div class=content>

    <p>
      You can draw a lot of fun curves even if you only know how to draw straight lines. For programmers, that means that a DrawLine function can be your friend.
      We start by having fun with a paper placemat and a pencil,
      end with the Four Ant Problem, and do some math and programming in
      between.
      Oh, and there's homework if you're up to it.
    </p>

  <h2>Placemat Spirals</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      Imagine that you're in an Italian restaurant with a rambunctious child,
      the dinner is slow to arrive and the child is getting restless.
      Here's an old-school way to distract them. Flip over your paper placemat
      and grab a pencil.
      Draw a straight line from the top left-hand corner to a point at
      distance d down from the top of the right-hand edge, where d is
      a small distance like a finger-width.
      This is shown in Step 1 of Figure 1.
      Then, draw a straight line from where it hits the
      right-hand edge to a point at
      distance d left from the bottom of the right-hand edge.
      This is shown in Step 2 of Figure 1.
      Next, draw a straight line from where it hits the
      bottom edge to a point at
      distance d up from the bottom of the left-hand edge.
      This is shown in Step 3 of Figure 1.
      Finally, draw a straight line from where it hits the
      left edge to a point at
      distance d to the right of the left edge,
      but this time measured along the line you drew in Step 1.
      This is shown in Step 4 of Figure 1.
    </p>

      <p>
        Figure 1: The first four lines on the back of a placemat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now repeat this process, each time measuring the distance d along your
      old line. Keep going until you run out of space.
      The process should look a bit like Figure 2. Notice that you see four
      spiralling curves, even though you drew only straight lines.
      Let's call these curves "placemat spirals".
    </p>

        Figure 2: Constructing a placemat spiral.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      One cool this about this is that you will get approximately the same curves
      no matter what your value of d is (so long as it is small),
      and it won't matter if your lines are wobbly,
      or if you don't measure d exactly right. Figure 3 shows a version that I drew
      by hand using a Paint tool.

      Figure 4 shows what it looks like if you start with a square.

    <p>
      You can take Figure 4, reflect it in the vertical axis,
      then reflect them both
      in the horizontal axis to give the tile in Figure 5.
      Some nasty Moire
      patterns start to show up when you scale these images, so I've added some
      random noise to the image to cancel them out.

      Let's tile four copies of Figure 6 to give Figure 7.
      The blurring caused by resizing is starting to hide
      the fact that these curves were created from straight lines.

    <p>
      Finally,
      let's tile four copies of Figure 7 to give Figure 8.
      Figure 8 uses 256 copies of Figure 4
      (128 left-handed and 128 right-handed).

  <h2>Fun with Code</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      Of course, I used a computer to draw
      Figures 2, 4-10.
      Writing a program to generate one of these spirals is
      a simple exercise in coding vector mathematics. All graphics APIs
      contain a line-drawing function. For example, DirectX 9 has a
      D3DXLINE object that will draw a series of straight lines for you.
      The following code asks the D3D device to create a line object for us,
      sets its thickness and turns antialiasing on.
    </p>

    <div class=code>
      const float LINETHICKNESS = 1.5f;<br>
      LPD3DXLINE line;<br>
      D3DXCreateLine(pD3DDevice, &line);<br>
      line->SetWidth(LINETHICKNESS);<br>
      line->SetAntialias(TRUE);<br>
    </div>

    <p>
      D3DX lines take an array of D3DXVECTOR2s and joins the dots with a
      series of lines. Let's declare such an array.
    </p>

    <div class=code>
      const int POINTCOUNT = 10000; //maximum number of points<br>
      D3DXVECTOR2 points[POINTCOUNT];<br>
      int pointcount=0; //number of points actually used
    </div>

    <p>
      Next, you need to write the code to fill in the array
      with the intersection points of our lines above.
      I'm not going to do it for you because it would make a nice exercise
      in my Game Math and Physics class. Rest assured that you should only need half
      a dozen lines of so of C++ code to get it right.
      Once you've done that, you can draw the lines by sticking
      the following code into your render loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure you get the line color right.
      It needs to be 0xFF000000 to get black lines.
      It's tempting to use
      color 0x00000000 instead, but that won't work. You have to
      set the alpha channel to 0xFF or else your lines will be completely
      transparent.
    </p>

    <div class=code>
      const unsigned int LINECOLOR = 0xFF000000; //black<br>
      line->Begin();<br>
      line->Draw(points, pointcount, LINECOLOR);<br>
      line->End();<br>
    </div>

    <p>
      Of course, like all DirectX objects, lines have to be released when
      you are through with them.
    </p>

    <div class=code>
      line->Release();
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <h2>What are Those Curves?</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      The mathematician in me wants to know the equation for those spirals.
      Conveniently, as d gets smaller, they seem to converge to
      a continuous curve as shown in Figure 11.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/converge256.gif">
    <div class=centered>
      <p>
        Figure 11: As d decreases the curves appear to converge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      It's easier to specify the curve in polar coordinates rather
      than Cartesian coordinates. Polar coordinates are defined by
      specifying a point for the Origin and a direction for an
      axis (or "pole").
      A point p in polar coordinates is then specified by
      an angle measured counterclockwise from the axis,
      and a distance to be measured along the line at that angle,
      as shown in Figure 12.
      If you're not familiar with polar coordinates, take a look at
      Chapter 7 of
      <a href="/ian/books/3dmathprimer/">Dunn and Parberry</a>.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/polar.png">
    <div class=centered>
      <p>
        Figure 12: Point p in polar coordinates.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      In polar coordinates, the i'th of the four placemat
      spirals is given by &theta; = ln(r)+c, where c
      is a constant that depends on the width of the square
      and i, and ln is the natural logarithm.
      The technical term for this is a logarithmic spiral.
      For example, the following code generates one
      of the arcs of the spiral.
    </p>

    <div class=code>
      void Spiral(D3DXVECTOR2 origin, D3DXVECTOR2* p, int max, float d){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;float r=0.0f, theta=0.0f;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;p[0] = origin;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;for(int i=1; i&lt;max; i++){<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r += d;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theta = log(r) - 2.0545f;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p[i] = origin + r*D3DXVECTOR2(cos(theta), -sin(theta));<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;} //for<br>
      } //Spiral<br>
    </div>

    <p>
      To check that it's the right function, you can try drawing
      the spiral generated by the above code on top of some
      placemat spirals (see Figure 13).

  <h2>The Four Ants Problem</h2>

  <div class=content>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/ants.png">
    <div class=centered>
      <p>
        Figure 14: Four ants named Albert, Brittany, Christopher, and Diane.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Suppose we have four ants A, B, C, and D at the four corners of a square
      as pictured in Figure 14 above.
      Starting at the same time and moving at the same speed,
      A walks towards B, B walks towards C, C walks towards D,
      and D walks towards A. As shown in Figure 15,
      the ants follow exactly the
      logarithmic spiral from Figure 4.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/ants256.gif">
    <div class=centered>
      <p>
        Figure 15: The paths traced by the ants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      There's a classical math question that asks how far each ant walks.
      It turns out that if the square has side of length s, then each
      ant walks distance exactly s. The intuition is that each ant
      moves (in the limit) orthogonally to the one chasing it, and thus never gets
      any further away. I tested this myself by printing a high-resolution
      version of Figure 4
      and cutting a piece of red string to the length of one of its sides
      (Figure 16).
      As you can see below, the path traced by one of the ants does appear
      to have the same length as the string (Figure 17),
      in accordance with the theory.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/length1.JPG">

    </p>
  </div>

    <p>
      Notice the Moire patterns in Figures 16 and 17.
      I added noise to Figure 5 to prevent that
      from happening in Figures 5-8, which is why they appear
      darker than Figure 4 even though the former are made from many
      copies of the latter.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Variations on a Theme</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      Of course, we don't have to restrict ourselves to rectangular placemats.
      Figure 18 shows the patterns that you get from some regular polygons
      from triangles up to decagons. Hexagons are of  particular interest
      because, like rectangles, they can be used to tile the plane
      as in Figure 21. The effect isn't as pleasing as Figures 5-8 because
      there's no obvious way of avoiding the discontinuity where the tiles meet.
    </p>

    <img class=centered alt="Image" src="images/shapes.gif">

        Figure 19: Tiling with the hexagons from Figure 18.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      We can mitigate the effect somewhat by taking a left-handed copy and
      overlaying it with a right-handed copy (of an n-gon where n is even)
      as in Figure 20. Doubled hexagons appear to
      tile without obvious discontinuities (Figure 21).

    <p>
      Triangles tile as well as rectangles if you
      flip alternate tiles, since an even number of triangles meet
      at any corner (See Figures 22 and 23).

  <h2>Homework</h2>

    <p>
    Here are a few homework exercises for aspiring graphics programmers.
    </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Given a distance d and a line segment pq
            between points p
            and q, devise a method to find the point r that is distance d from p
            along pq, as shown in Figure 26.
            You will probably need the following concepts:
            vector addition, vector length, vector multiplication
            by a scalar, and vector normalization. If your method uses trig
            functions, then you are probably overthinking it.

          hexagons from Exercise 8. You'll have to use a little trigonometry to
          get the spacing right.
          Figure 31 shows a screenshot of my app under Windows.

          Combine your solutions to Exercises 5 and 8 to produce an
          app that can animate n ants on an n-gon. Figure 32 shows
          3 ants on a triangle,
          8 ants on an octagon,
          and 20 ants on a 20-gon.
