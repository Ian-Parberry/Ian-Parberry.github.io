    <h2>Director of Computer Science, Nerd Kingdom, Aug. 2012 - May 2013</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <img class=centered width="120px" src="images/nerdslogo.png" alt="Image">
      <p>
        Responsibilities included setting up a development team in Texas
        for this California-based company and directing the creation
        of procedural content generation tools and techniques for their
        game TUG.
      </p>

    <h2>Consultant, Infomover Inc., 1998-2007</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <p>
        Mobile inventory system.
        Responsibilities include technical consultant to the programming team,
        adviser on setting
        and maintaining business communication structure between development,
        sales, and management.
        One of the things I got them to do was keep offsite backups, which is
        just as well because the place burned
        to the ground in 2007. The lead programmer still had the software,
        but the company had no fire insurance so it folded.

    <h2>Scientist, Bonanza.com, 2000-2001</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <img class=centered src="images/bonanza.png" alt="Image">
      <p>
        Responsibilities included design and analysis of algorithms for the core technology of an internet barter site.
        The company crashed and burned at the start of the Great Dot Com Crash. It had a product ready to release but
        had burned through round 2 of venture capital funding and investors at the time were very shy of investing in internet
        based companies.

        Developer of TrapWords,
        a word game using hexagonal tiles. It never was sold, but you can find it for free online.
        There is also a board game version, but I had nothing to do with it.

    <h2>Consultant, 7th Level, 1997</h2>

    <div class=content>
      <img src="images/g-nome.png" class=centered alt="Image">
      <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Nome">G-Nome</a>. I didn't get paid and they ignored my advice, but I got
        <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/g-nome/credits">listed in the credits</a>.
        OK, it only says "Special Thanks To", but hey, it's a credit.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Level">7th Level</a> crashed and burned the same year.

    <h2>Contractor, Spectrum Pacific Publishing, 1995-1997</h2>

    <div class=content>

      </div>
      <p>
        In 1996 I finished a DOS game called Subhunt with the help of
        some students in <a href="http://larc.unt.edu">LARC</a>. My idea was that we could fund the lab
        with the income from shareware games. It failed miserably, but it was a lot of fun to work on.
        I think I started working on it in 1994 or 1995. It was released in 1997 under contract by WebFoot Games in the US
        and Spectrum Pacific Publishing in Australia and the Pacific Rim. The game is now orphaned, which means
        you can find it for free online in some archives of old games.
