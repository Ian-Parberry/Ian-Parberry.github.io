<h4 class=mini>Chapter 1: Read me First</h4>
Before we get started, let's take a look at why this book exists,
what I expect you to know before you can start reading it, 
what the stuff inside will be like stylistically, and what you can
expect to get out of it if you put a reasonable amount of effort into it.

<h2>Part I: Introduction to Game Physics</h2>

<div class=content><table class=main width=720 cellspacing=10>


<tr>

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 2: Mathematics for Game Physics</h4>
We start off pedal to the metal by examining the mathematical
foundation of game physics and how it can be applied in practice.
We'll be doing some Geometry, Linear Algebra, and Calculus. Thanks to Ren&eacute; Descartes, 
we learn that Geometry and Linear Algebra are really the same thing, which is really great news.

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 3: A Rigid Body Physics Game</h4>

Now we put the concepts learned in Chapter 2 to the test
by coding the end game in 8-ball pool.

<tr>

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 4: A Soft Body Physics Toy</h4>
Having been introduced to the theory of Verlet integration and Gauss-Seidel relaxation
in Chapter 2, we now examine code for a Ball and Spring Toy, which allows you
to play with various springy-things and a ragdoll robot named Woodie.

<h2>Part II: Game Physics with Box2D</h2>

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 5: Getting Started</h4>
Now we get you started with Box2D by showing you how to download it and
integrate it with your game code. After running you quickly through the
basic concepts, it demonstrates the
process with a quick toy that lets you drop balls and books out of the sky.

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 6: A Tale of Three Modules</h4>
Box2D is broken up into three basic modules called the
Common Module, the Collision Module, 
and the Dynamics Module. Let's drill down into them in enough detail
that we can begin writing a game.

<tr>
<td valign=middle>
<img src="../images/cannon.gif" alt=image>
<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 7: The Cannon Game</h4>
The Cannon Game gives the player control of a cannon in a world
with a tempting tower of books.
The player's job is to knock down the tower in 60 seconds or less by firing cannonballs at it.

<tr>
<td valign=middle>
<img src="../images/stars.gif" alt=image>
<td>
<h4 class=mini>Chapter 8: The Collision Module</h4>
We now drill down a little into the Collision Module, which
starts by looking more closely at contacts and contact manifolds before introducing
the contact listener, which is an efficient way of having Box2D notify your
program about collisions. It finishes with some heavy geek stuff about AABBs and Dynamic Trees.

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Appendix A: For Math Geeks Only</h4>
For the math geeks among you, let's prove the identities 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cos (&alpha; + &beta;) = cos &alpha; cos &beta; - sin &alpha; sin &beta;, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin (&alpha; + &beta;) = sin &alpha; cos &beta; + cos &alpha; sin &beta;
<br>
from Chapter 2.

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Appendix B: The Blacke Arte of Program Debugging</h4>
Unfortunately we spend much more time teaching programming than we do teaching debugging skills
even though the professional programmer typically spends a large fraction of their time debugging.
That tends to make students think that bugs are things to be ashamed of.

<tr>
<td valign=middle>
<img src="query-bang.gif" alt=image>
<td>
<h4 class=mini>Appendix C: There are, In Fact, Dumb Questions</h4>
I stop answering dumb questions about programming
once my students reach a certain level of programming skill.
Don't let anybody tell you that there's no such thing as a dumb question.
My definition of a dumb question about programming
is a question that can be answered by experimenting with code.

<tr>
<td valign=middle>
<img src="bulletphysics.png" alt=image>

<td>
<h4 class=mini>Appendix D: Bullet Physics</h4>
Bullet Physics is a lot more sophisticated than Box2D,
but once you start working with it you will find that they have some concepts in common.
For example, where Box2D has the Physics World b2World, Bullet Physics has the Dynamics World.
