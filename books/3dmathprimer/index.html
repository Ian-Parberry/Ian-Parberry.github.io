  <h2>From the Back Cover</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      This engaging book presents the essential mathematics needed to describe,
      simulate, and render a 3D world. Reflecting both academic and in-the-trenches
      practical experience, the authors teach you how to describe objects and
      their positions, orientations, and trajectories in 3D using mathematics.
      The text provides an introduction to mathematics for game designers and
      graphics programmers, including the fundamentals of coordinate spaces,
      vectors, and matrices. It also covers orientation in three dimensions,
      calculus and dynamics, graphics, and parametric curves.

      "With solid theory and references, along with practical advice borne from decades of experience,
      all presented in an informal and demystifying style, Dunn &amp; Parberry provide
      an accessible and useful approach to the key mathematical operations needed in 3D computer graphics."

  <h2>From the Introduction</h2>

  <div class=content>
    <p>
      This book is about 3D math, the geometry and algebra of 3D space. It
      is designed to teach you how to describe objects and their positions, orientations,
      and trajectories in 3D using mathematics. This is not a book
      about computer graphics, simulation, or even computational geometry, although
      if you plan on studying those subjects, you will definitely need the
      information here.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not just a book for video game programmers. We do assume
      that a majority of our readers are learning for the purpose of programming
      video games, but we expect a wider audience and we have designed the
      book with a diverse audience in mind. If you're a programmer or interested
      in learning how to make video games, welcome aboard! If you meet neither
      of these criteria, there's still plenty for you here. We have made every effort
      to make the book useful to designers and technical artists. Although there
      are several code snippets in the book, they are (hopefully) easy to read even
      for nonprogrammers. Most important, even though it is always necessary
      to understand the surrounding concepts to make sense of the code, the
      reverse is never true. We use code samples to illustrate how ideas can be
      implemented on a computer, not to explain the ideas themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      The title of this book says it is for "game development," but a great
      deal of the material that we cover is applicable outside of video games.
      Practically anyone who wants to simulate, render, or understand a three-dimensional
      world will find this book useful. While we do try to provide
      motivating examples from the world of video game development, since that
      is our area of expertise and also our primary target audience, you won't be
      left out if the last game you completed was Space Quest.
      (Well, you may be left out of a few jokes, like that one. Sorry.) If your interests
      lie in more "grown up" things than video games, rest assured that this book
      is not filled with specific examples from video games about head-shots or
      severed limbs or how to get the blood spurt to look just right.
