        Ian Parberry received a Bachelor of Science with First
        Class Honours in Computer Science and Mathematics in 1981 from
        the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">University of Queensland</a> in Australia and
        a PhD in Computer Science in 1984 from the <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/">University of Warwick</a>
        in England.  He then took up a tenure-track position in the US
        at the rank of Assistant Professor.
        He was promoted to Associate Professor
        in 1990 (receiving tenure in 1991) and to Full Professor in 1995.
        He is author of over 100 technical <a href="pubs">publications</a> including
        over 75 articles  (23 as sole author) in peer-reviewed journals, conferences,
        and workshops.
        His publications have been
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8ZpdXNcAAAAJ">cited</a>
        thousands of times, his h-index is 28, his i10-index is 60, and his

        Ian Parberry is a pioneer
        of academic game development education and research who
        has been  <a href="/classes">teaching</a> game programming to undergraduates since 1993, when he
        established the Laboratory for Recreational Computing (<a href="/">LARC</a>).
        LARC alumni  have credits on at least <a href="/alumnigames.html">
          66 commercial
          video games
        </a>
        that have sold a total of over
        <a href="/alumnigames3.html">180 million copies</a>, estimated to be worth more than $9 billion in revenue.
        The most famous of these alumni  is <a href="/jasonwest">Jason West</a>, co-founder
        of the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise.
        The Princeton Review and GamePro Magazine evaluated
        UNT LARC in the top 50 out of
        500 game design programs in North America in 2010.

      <p>
        Dr. Parberry's notable research achievements include the
        invention (with Dr. Leslie M. Goldschlager in 1981, published in 1986)
        of the complexity class &oplus;P
        (independently invented by Dr. Christos Papadimitriou);
        the first description (with Dr. Piotr Berman and Dr. Georg Schnitger in 1986)
        of the complexity class TC<sup>0</sup>;
        the first proof (in 1989) that there is no 9-input sorting network of depth 6;
        and the first proof (with PhD student H.-L. Tseng in 1996) that
        conventional computers can be exponentially faster than
        neural networks (specifically, planar Hopfield networks).
        He has two NP-completeness results to his credit:
        the verification problem for logarithmic depth sorting networks,
        and the loading problem for
        6-node neural networks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dr. Parberry's current research interests are clustered around game development,
