        I served as Interim Chair of the <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu">Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>
        at the <a href="http://www.unt.edu">University of North Texas</a>
        for two years from September 1, 2009 to August 31, 2011.
        I was initially appointed for a single year, but when the external Chair Search failed in 2010 I was
        invited to serve for a second year until (thankfully) my replacement was found.

        10 Teaching Assistants, 3.5 Administrative Assistants, and 2.25 technicians.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offered undergraduate degrees in Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
        and Information Technology; Master's degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering; and a PhD in Computer Science and Engineering.
        It had 374 undergraduate majors, 105 pre-majors, 139 Master's students and 56 PhD students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The University of North Texas described itself at the time as a "student-centered,
