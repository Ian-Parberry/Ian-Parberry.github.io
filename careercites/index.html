      <p>
I was a little surprised to see
<a href="https://research.unt.edu/news/unt_faculty_among_2024_list_of_worlds_most_cited_researchers.html#:~:text=In%20the%20latest%20lists%2C%2041,made%20the%202024%20annual%20list.">this 2025 article</a>
from UNT's Research and Innovation journalists which lists me as being in the top 2&percnt; of scientists
in my field over the course of my career to 2024
"based on standardized citation metrics developed by a group
of scientists led by John P.A. Ioannidis, a statistician at Stanford University."
(I'm not sure how long that link will stay active; here is a <a href=unt.png>screenshot</a> instead.)
I was immediately curious about what that meant exactly
and although confident in all research done by Ioannidis and his coauthors (based
on past experience), I am not so confident in the ability of journalists
not to mislead readers, either intentionally or unintentionally
(also based on past experience).
Fortunately, the data from Ioannidis <em>et al.</em> is available from the Elsevier Data Repository
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7">here</a>.

According to the <a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7">title page</a>,
<blockquote cite="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7">
"Career-long data are updated to end-of-2023 and single recent year data pertain to citations received
during calendar year 2023. The selection is based on the top 100,000 scientists by c-score (with and
without self-citations) or a percentile rank of 2% or above in the sub-field. This version (7) is based
on the August 1, 2024 snapshot from Scopus, updated to end of citation year 2023. This work uses Scopus data.
Calculations were performed using all Scopus author profiles as of August 1, 2024."

After downloading this repository and opening the file 

<div class="blockquote">
<span style='font-family: monospace, Consolar, DejaVu Sans Mono, Lucida Console, Courier, "Courier New";'>Table_1_Authors_career_2023_pubs_since_1788_wopp_extracted_202408.xlsx</span>
</div>

with Microsoft&#174; Excel&#174;,
we find my entry on line 202,443 out of 217,098,
It lists
my field of research as <em>Information &amp; Communication Technologies</em> (column AR)
based on the
classification table that you can
<a href="https://science-metrix.com/classification/">download from Science Metrix</a>.
</p>

  <a name="fig1"></a>

	  <b>Fig. 1:</b> My Science Metrix field (pink) with the two subfields listed by Ioannidis <em>et al.</em>.
	</p>
  </div>

<p>
The <a href="https://science-metrix.com/classification/">Science Metrix table</a>
lists eight subfields of <em>Information and Communication Technologies</em> (see Fig.1),
including <em>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Image Processing</em>
and <em>Computation Theory &amp; Mathematics</em>,
which Ioannidis <em>et al.</em> list 
in the Microsoft&#174; Excel&#174; file mentioned above
as my first and second subfields, respectively (columns AN and AP).
The six subfields from the <a href="https://science-metrix.com/classification/">Science Metrix table</a>
not listed in Fig. 1 are
<em>Computer Hardware &amp; Architecture</em>,
<em>Distributed Computing</em>,
<em>Information Systems</em>,
<em>Medical Informatics</em>,
<em>Networking &amp; Telecommunications</em>, and
<em>Software Engineering</em>.
Admittedly, this is a poor way of describing Computer Science research areas
compared to, say, the
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/ccs">ACM Computing Classification System</a>.
</p>

<p>
My rank in the sub-field <em>Artificial Intelligence &amp; Image Processing</em> (not counting self-citations)
is 7,350 (column AU) out of 399,065 (column AV). Since 7,350 divided by 399,065 is slightly more than 0.018,
this puts me in the top 1.8&percnt;. This explains why I am in the table at all: 
it is because (as quoted above) I have
"a percentile rank of 2&percnt; or above in the sub-field".
If you are curious about how <em>rank</em> is determined by Ioannidis <em>et al.</em>, see 
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000918">Updated science-wide
author databases of standardized citation indicators</a>, <em>PLOS Biology</em>, 2020.

<p>
The above information is based on Version 7 of the data,
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7">V7, 15 September 2024</a>,
which is the latest available at time of writing.
My name also appears in
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/6">V6, 3 October 2023</a> (line 193,262),
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/5">V5, 2 November 2022</a> (line 183,965),
and
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/4">V4, 9 October 2022</a> (line 184,704).
However, it does not appear in
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/3">V3, 19 October 2021</a>,
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/2">V2, 7 October 2020</a>,
or 
<a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/1">V1, 5 July 2019</a>.
Either something in the data has changed, or I have entered the top 2&percnt; of scientists
only since 2022, which happens to be the year of my retirement.
