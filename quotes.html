  <h2>General</h2>

  <div class=content>
    C.S.Lewis:
    <div class=blockquote>
      When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.
    </div>

    <div class=blockquote>
      It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail.
    </div>

    Sign hanging in Einstein's office at Princeton:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.
    </div>

    Blaise Pascal, Lettres Provinciales, 1657:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Je n'ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n'ai pas eu le
      loisir de la faire plus courte.
        (I have made this [letter] longer
        because I did not have the leisure to make it shorter.)
    </div>

    Ralph Waldo Emerson:
    <div class=blockquote>
      A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
    </div>

    Groucho Marx:
    <div class=blockquote>
      I wouldn't be a member of any club that would have me as a member.
    </div>

    Plato, <cite>Phaedrus</cite>:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Then anyone who leaves behind him a written manual, and likewise
      anyone who receives it, in the belief that such writing will be clear
      and certain, must be exceedingly simple-minded.
    </div>

    A. A. Milne:
    <div class=blockquote>
      One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly
      making exciting discoveries.
    </div>

    Albert Einstein:
    <div class=blockquote>
      If A equals success, then the formula is: A=X+Y+Z.
      X is work. Y is play. Z is keep your mouth shut.

      Them that has the gold makes the rules.

    Teddy Roosevelt:
    <div class=blockquote>
      It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the
      strong man stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
      The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face
      is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly;
      who errs and comes up short again and again;
      who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends
      himself in a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows in the end the
      triumph of high achievement; and who at the worst,
      at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall
      never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither
      victory nor defeat.
    </div>

    Albert Einstein:
    <div class=blockquote>
      As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Computers</h2>

  <div class=content>
    Pablo Picasso:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.
    </div>

    Alan Perlis:
    <div class=blockquote>
      It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to
      program.  What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in
      organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be
      self-critical?
    </div>

    Alan Perlis:
    <div class=blockquote>
      I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science
      keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of
      course, the paying customer got shafted every now and then, and after a
      while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if
      we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of
      these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for
      stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in
      the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of
      fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if
      you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you
      know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to
      successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think
      and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than
      when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.
    </div>

    Manuel Blum, FOCS 94:
    <div class=blockquote>
      I have a good idea why it's hard to verify programs.  They're usually wrong.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Thinking and Problem Solving</h2>

  <div class=content>
    Hoare's Law of Large Problems:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Inside every large problem is a small problem struggling to get out.
    </div>

    H. L. Mencken:
    <div class=blockquote>
      For every complex problem, there is a solution that is simple, neat,
      and wrong.
    </div>

    Murray Gell-mann:
    <div class=blockquote>
      The Feynman Problem-Solving Algorithm:
      (1) write down the problem; (2) think very hard; (3) write down the
      answer.
    </div>

    Bertrand Russell:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Many people would rather die than think. In fact they do.
    </div>

    Michel de Montaigne:
    <div class=blockquote>
      Difficulty is a coin the learned make use of like jugglers, to conceal the inanity of their art.
    </div>

    Plato:
    <div class=blockquote>
      I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning.
    </div>

    Marvin Minsky:
    <div class=blockquote>
      I bet the human brain is a kludge.
    </div>

    <a name=tenure>Daniel Dennett</a>,
    <cite>Consciousness Explained</cite>:
    <div class=blockquote>
      The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for
      a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its
      home for life.  For this task it has a rudimentary nervous system.
      When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain any
      more so it eats it.  It's rather like getting
      tenure.
